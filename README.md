This proposal is a new approach to localize FileMaker apps rendered by FileMaker Pro 16.
This proposal provides :
- a standard for structuring localization data in JSON format;
- the different elements can be localized in a FileMaker app;
- tools to manage the localization of FileMaker apps.

This goal is to adopt a common standard and popularize it in our developments.
